    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ pound pork liver</li>
      <li>½ pound pork lung</li>
      <li>½ pound pork heart, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>½ cup distilled white vinegar</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the pork liver and the pork lung in two separate pots and cover
        with water. Bring each pot to a boil; cook at a boil until tender, about
        10 minutes. Drain both and allow to cool before chopping into bite-size
        pieces. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the liver, lung, and heart in a large pot over medium heat; add
        the bay leaves, vinegar, and water. Season with salt and pepper. Bring
        the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook
        the onion and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes.
        Stir the tomatoes into the mixture and simmer 5 minutes. Pour the pork
        liver mixture from the pot into the saucepan; cook and stir together for
        5 minutes more. Serve hot.
