    <h3>Filipino Coconut Garlic Fried Rice (Sinangag)</h3>
    <p>
      You can make this super-delicious Filipino coconut garlic fried rice
      (sinangag) mostly ahead of time because you need the steamed rice to cool
      and dry out a bit before you fry it. The final result is addictive and
      goes with everything on this menu, so I like to make two batches—one plain
      and one with the optional turmeric—which adds a little extra flavor and a
      pretty orange color.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups uncooked jasmine rice</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
      <li>½ (15 ounce) can unsweetened coconut cream</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground turmeric (Optional)</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
      <li>¼ cup finely chopped garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place rice in a large bowl with enough water to cover by a few inches;
        swirl with your fingers, then drain. Repeat until water runs clear,
        about 3 times.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine rice, 1 1/2 cups water, coconut cream, turmeric, and salt in a
        saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice
        is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Chill, uncovered, 2
        to 4 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat coconut oil in a 12-inch skillet or wok over high heat. Add garlic;
        cook until it just begins to brown, about 1 minute. Add rice and spread
        in an even layer; cook, without stirring, until lightly browned and
        crisp on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Add fish sauce; cook, stirring,
        until fully combined and heated through, about 2 minutes.
